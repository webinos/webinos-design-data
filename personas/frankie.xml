<persona name="Frankie" type="Primary" assumption_persona="TRUE" image="/home/irisuser/webinos/wp2/personas/frankie.jpg" >
  <activities>Frankie is an alienated computer addict. He started using computer at the age of six, when he was troubled by the separation of his parents, and all his life has been centered on computers ever since. Up to now, he has had a quite normal student career, without any notable brilliance or related achievements.</activities>
  <attitudes>He never established strong friendships and can only express himself through computers. Since computers have been his main friends, he has failed to pick up some society norms and values, including commonly known laws and rules.

The parent's separation gave him an inner sense of rage and frustration, making him quarrelsome and vexatious. Sadly, he is just looking for attention and support, but he's not able to express this to anyone in person.

His present hobbys involve malicious computer actions, however, his knowledge of security is naive, and he can only us publicly-available tools for exploiting systems. He is constantly seeking attention and recognition and usually brags about his stunts on internet. This gains him only disregard from his victims and scorn from real security experts.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>The very early emotional trauma he suffered deprived him of his motivation to learn. He just wants attention, but no one has taught him the right way to get self-esteem. So, he learns to take the easy option and the "fast way" toward his goals, not understanding the fruitfulness of the longer ones. He is involved in a number of licit or illicit tasks (Wi-F cracking, virus spreading) but he has no more than a superficial knowledge and interest in any of them.</aptitudes>
  <motivations>He wants to damage others and gain money in order to attract attention, and achieve a fake sense of control in a otherwise unhappy and unimportant life.</motivations>
  <skills>He has an understanding of computers and Internet, but due to his lack of motivation for education and learning, his knowledge is only a little above average, especially regarding public (or almost public) domain software used to hack networks.</skills>
