<persona name="Ethan" type="Primary" assumption_persona="TRUE" image="/home/irisuser/webinos/wp2/personas/ethan.png" >
  <activities>Ethan is a student just like many others: he has no particular problems or outstanding successes. Unlike many others, he believes that taking some shortcuts (of dubious legality) can be of some help. In order to gain some extra spending-money and fill his always-empty student pockets, he devotes part of his time to earning money illegally as a spammer. One of his activities, for example, is sending messages on behalf of individuals who sell counterfeit good, or participating in an email campaign for a "pump and dump" scheme.</activities>
  <attitudes>Much like many other students, Ethan does not have a strong inclination toward rules and laws. In fact, he has a quite pronounced inclination toward illicit activities that can be more or less remunerative. However, he still doesn't want to get in trouble with the law, he is just willing to risk it because he wants money even more.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Ethan has cultivated some of the essential skills for his fraudulent network activities. His habitual tasks consist in looking for vulnerable networks, exploiting such vulnerabilities and then gathering data from those non security-savvy systems. Whenever possible and whenever he thinks it is not too risky, he enjoys accessing and taking control of vulnerable systems and harvesting data from vulnerable targets. When successful, this often includes usernames, passwords, and also details of credit cards that have been illicitly gained by other malicious intruders. This information can be profitably used for trading of credit card number (good offers for them in Black Market) and for circumvent monitoring system and anti-spam filters.</aptitudes>
  <motivations>He wants easy money, since in his opinion it is very rarely the most tiresome way that is the best one. During his student career, he has found it difficult to make much money in legal ways. Since he already has a botnet at his service, why not use it for some additional source of wealth? Being a botnet administrator has many other benefits. For example, he can attack politicians with whom he disagrees. After all, Ethan has some sense of civic responsibility in his own way.</motivations>
  <skills>Ethan most important skills lies in the administrator-level knowledge of a botnet, and on the knowledge of how exploit it for illicit spamming activities and other illicit activities using them. For these reasons, knowledge of using spamming tools is of benefit to his business.</skills>
