  <consequences>The user believes their actions are not linked together and potentially anonymous, when they are not.  This could cause embarassment or privacy-loss: e.g., targetted adverts might reveal the user's private interests or activities.  This could also build a false impression of the user on a marketing site, or cause them to receive SPAM.</consequences>


  <implementation>
    <description>Jimmy creates a legitimate application which uses various unimportant APIs, inluding the discovery API.  Through the discovery API he is able to retrieve identifiers for webinos services hosted in the user's personal zone.  These are persistent.  Jimmy combines these identifies with records about the user's activity on the application and sells them to an online analytics firm who combines this information with other instances of these service identifiers.</description>
