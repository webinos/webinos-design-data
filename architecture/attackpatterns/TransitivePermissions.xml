  <implementation>
    <description>Frankie creates an application which appears to be legitimate and only requests minimal permissions.  Even if untrusted, many users are likely to install it and trust the webinos security framework to protect it once it has been uploaded to an app store.  However, the application makes use of an unprotected communication interface with another application (which has access to many APIs) to read user data.  Frankie makes sure that his app uploads this data to is servers...</description>
