  <implementation>
    <description>Jimmy creates a legitimate and generally non-malicious web application which the end user installs.  However, Jimmy designs it so that it accesses both webinos APIs and browser APIs, depending on what is available at the time.  When the user turns off access to geolocation using webinos, Jimmy's app automatically invokes the browser API instead which has already been authorised.</description>
